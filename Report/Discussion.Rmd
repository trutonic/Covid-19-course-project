# Overall impression

This report is primarily focused on the differences between countries' ability to recover from the initial negative economic associations that came with COVID-19. It utilized the overall wealth of a country along with the proportion of the population with COVID-19 infections to find this difference in recovery. To gauge this economic recovery from COVID-19, the data was broken up into fiscal quarters, and specifically utilized the third quarter of 2020, which was the quarter where the economy began to recover. A two-factor ANOVA model was produced to explain the variance observed in percentage GDP change between countries in quarter 3. The factors: proportion of the population infected with COVID-19 and GDP per capita consisted of three levels each with relative amounts. The model did not find any statistical significance for either factor, but did not account for the interaction factor between the two factors. The report concludes that the factors are not explicable in the variation observed in GDP recovery and briefly discusses possible reasons why such as the limitation of the dataset.
The report was rather extensive in its exploration of the relationship between GDP and COVID-19 as a medium to discuss any possible effect of the pandemic on the economy. The report excelled in its understanding and presentation of the subject matter, but could use more focus. The descriptive analysis explores much of the data graphically, but could align more with the narrative of the report as it concluded with descriptive analysis and conclusion. The model produced to explore the relationship was straightforward and chose variables appropriately considering the subject, but did not include interaction effects which may have explained some of the variation observed. The diagnostics were extensive and reinforced the statistically analysis presented in the descriptive analysis. The conclusion is presented concisely but does not discuss the implications of the conclusion or present many explanations. Overall, the report is extensive and informative but would benefit from an improved conclusion and focus.

# Major comments 

1. The conclusion could use more explanation when it comes to the results. The report states, “We determine that the proportion of the population infected with COVID-19 and GDP per capita were not explicable in the variation observed in percentage GDP change in quarter 3 between each country.” Although the conclusion provides possible explanations as to why there is a lack of association between the percentage change in GDP and the two variables, it only focuses on the lack of up-to-date information on GDP. Rather than just concluding that there is a lack of up-to-date information or missing information, there should be a more thorough explanation for this conclusion that draws from real-word explanations or scenarios. There can be explanations for this conclusion, such as confounding variables, which can be a result of different policies set forth or any other factors specific to a certain country or geographic region. 

2. The two-factor ANOVA model produced in the inferential analysis should include interaction terms. The interaction term examines the effects of levels of one factor on the levels of the other factor, by excluding it from the analysis the question of interaction between COVID-19 infections and GDP per capita for each country is unresolved. If the interaction is non-significant it should be reported and discussed, if the interaction is significant the conclusion of the report should be changed to reflect this.

3. The descriptive analysis should be more reflective of the resulting statistical model explored in the inferential analysis. In other words, the descriptive analysis should lead up to the relation of GDP change to COVID-19 cases and GDP per capita. Graphs visualizing the relationship between each variable in the following model should be present, for example. Also, some of the data analyzed in the descriptive analysis, such as deaths, is not statistically relevant to the model and should probably be excluded unless it is explored further. 

4. There were a few instances where the word ‘impact’ was used, mainly in the context of describing how Covid-19 had an ‘impact’ on economic activity due to proportion of the population with COVID-19 infections and relative wealth of a nation. However, there should not be any causal statements made in the project unless they feel very confident about this causal inference. If no causal inference can be made, we can only conclude that there are associations between the two variables. This is because there may be other factors that can contribute to this change in economic activity that weren't included in the original model such as lifestyle or transportation. 

5. The introduction could go into more detail regarding the context of the time period explored in the data analysis, quarter 3. The third quarter of 2020 was remarked with almost universal economic recovery due to the adjustments and relaxing of regulations made following the sudden stipulations applied to commerce for initial lockdown/quarantine during quarter 2. This quarter was also when many countries saw their initial waves of COVID-19 cases, such as those in South-East Asia and Africa. The introduction should make note of distinctions of this quarter in the context of the ongoing pandemic, and they should be considered in the conclusion during discussions of confounders.


# Minor comments 

Visuals:

* In addition to what has been stated in Major Comments No. 3, graphs and visuals should be strategically selective and condensed. Having graphs and visuals can reveal great insights, but having too many graphs can cause confusion or redundancy. As an example, see Section 4.1.1 on the report. There are two graphs that are plotting the same thing. The only thing that differs them is removing a few points to zoom into the denser area, but the graph is not much more intuitive than the first.

# Questions to address during the final presentation

1. Is the interaction term significant or non-significant? If so, which interaction terms are significantly different and how does this change the conclusion?
2. What are some confounding variables that could explain why was there no significance observed?
3. How might the findings of this report apply to other quarters or time periods during the pandemic and what is the applicability of these findings to our current or future situation?
4. What are some other ideas that can be discussed to further explore the association of economy and COVID-19?
5. What could be some explanations for the uniform global recovery in GDP in Q3?
