# Overall impression



# Major comments 

* Add descriptive/supporting analysis in the background. What have other studies shown? This could be a good addition because it can show what other studies have found on economic activity and Covid-19.
* Take the log: Maybe include a country's new cases per quarter, calculate the deaths per quarter or use case mortality rates
* Delve deeper into which factor is associated with which. Could economic recovery be playing a factor on Covid-19 cases? Why is this not the case? Explain.

1. The conclusion could use more explanation when it comes to the results. The report states, “We determine that the proportion of the population infected with COVID-19 and GDP per capita were not explicable in the variation observed in percentage GDP change in quarter 3 between each country.” Although the conclusion provides possible explanations as to why there is a lack of association between the percentage change in GDP and the two variables, it only focuses on the lack of up to date information on GDP. Rather than just concluding that there is a lack of up to date information or missing information, there should be a more thorough explanation for this conclusion that draws from real-word explanations or scenarios. There can be explanations for this conclusion, such as confounding variables, which can be a result of different policies set forth or any other factors specific to a certain country or geographic region. 

2. The two-factor ANOVA model produced in the inferential analysis should include interaction terms. The interaction term examines the effects of levels of one factor on the levels of the other factor, by excluding it from the analysis the question of interaction between COVID-19 infections and GDP per capita for each country is unresolved. If the interaction is non-significant it should be reported and discussed, if the interaction is significant the conclusion of the report should be changed to reflect this.

3. The descriptive analysis should be more reflective of the resulting statistical model explored in the inferential analysis. In other words, the descriptive analysis should lead up to the relation of GDP change to COVID-19 cases and GDP per capita. Graphs visualizing the relationship between each variable in the following model should be present, for eaxmple. Also, some of the data analyzed in the descriptive analysis, such as deaths, is not statistically relevant to the model and should probably be excluded unless it is explored further. 

4. There were a few instances where the word ‘impact’ was used, mainly in the context of describing how Covid-19 had an ‘impact’ on economic activity due to proportion of the population with COVID-19 infections and relative wealth of a nation. However, there should not be any causal statements made in the project unless they feel very confident about this causal inference. If no causal inference can be made, we can only conclude that there are associations between the two variables. This is because there may be other factors that can contribute to this change in economic activity that werent included in the original model such as lifestyle or transportation. 

5. The introduction could go into more detail regarding the context of the time period explored in the data analysis, quarter 3. The third quarter of 2020 was remarked with almost universal economic recovery due to the adjustments and relaxing of regulations made following the sudden stipulations applied to commerce for initial lockdown/quarantine during quarter 2. This quarter was also when many countries saw their initial waves of COVID-19 cases, such as those in South-East Asia and Africa. The introduction should make note of distinctions of this quarter in the context of the ongoing pandemic, and they should be considered in the conclusion during discussions of confounders.


# Minor comments 
Visuals:

* In addition to what has been stated in Major Comments No. 3, graphs and visuals should be strategically selective and condensed. Having graphs and visuals can reveal great insights, but having too many graphs can cause confusion or redundancy. As an example, see Section 4.1.1 on the report. There are two graphs that are plotting the same thing. The only thing that differs them is removing a few points to zoom into the denser area, but the graph is not much more intuitive than the first.

Typos:
* 4.1.3 of Descriptive Analysis: ‘begining,' ‘differnce’ 
* 4.1.5 of Descriptive Analysis: ‘noticble’
* 4.4 of Descriptive Analysis: ‘here here’
* Inferential Analysis: ‘signicance,’ ‘signficantly,’ ‘signficant’
* Model Diagnostics: 'signicance,' 'signficant,' 'signficant'
* Various missing commas throughout the report
* 'gdp' is not fully capitalized as it should be many times throughout the report
